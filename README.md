# London-Energy-Analysis

# Project Overview

This project examines the correlation between weather conditions and energy consumption in London using data from Kaggle.
Data Processing
Pandas was used for organizing and cleaning the data sets, making it ready for analysis.

# Visualizations

Seaborn was employed to create visual representations for a clearer understanding of the data. I also utilized matplotlib to create plots and bar graphs on my network.

# Neural Network

A TensorFlow-based neural network was implemented for regression analysis, keeping the model simple.

# Data Preparation

Data underwent basic conversions to ensure consistency and normalization for improved model processing.

# Feature Sensitivity Analysis

Identified key variables through a straightforward feature sensitivity analysis.

# Multiple Regression

Used Scikit-Learn for multiple regression analysis, providing correlation coefficients for a quantitative assessment of variable relationships.
